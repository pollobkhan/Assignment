            <p>Staying focused on something for a fixed time period enables you to accomplish a better quality of work,
                tasks
                get finished quickly, and your creativity and ideas come easier. Staying focused on a single task at a
                time
                puts
                less stress on your mind. And being less stressed permits you to be a lot happier.</p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>A vision is your school's goal — where you hope to see it in the future. The mission provides an overview
                of the steps planned to achieve that future. A vision is concise and easy to recall, whereas a mission
                is lengthier and more explanatory in nature.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>All students are empowered to learn and achieve, to experience high quality teaching practice and the
                best conditions for learning which equip them with the knowledge, skills and dispositions for lifelong
                learning and to shape the world around them.</p>

        <div class="mission-width" id="goal">

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The main point of setting goals is to help students take realistic steps to achieve them. Many educators
                find that using the SMART format—goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and
                timely—is practical and reasonable, and keeps students on track.</p>
