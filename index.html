    <h1>Stay Focused on <br><span>Mission 2022</span></h1>
    <p>When you come around the term “Stay Focused,” it would mean to keep yourself occupied with the task you have at
        hand rather than getting distracted by something that would affect your productivity. Focus is considered at the
        heart of everything necessary, such as perception, memory, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision
        making.</p>
